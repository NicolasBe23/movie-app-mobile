# General Coding Rules

- Don't include comments in your code
- Don't run anything in the terminal
- Don't install packages or dependencies
- All code should be written cleanly and concisely

# Project Stack

- Use Next.js with App Router
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use only functional components
- Use React Server Components by default
- Use 'use client' only when absolutely necessary

# TypeScript Rules

- Avoid using the `any` type
- Explicitly type all function parameters and return types
- Use interfaces for object forms instead of types
- Use union types instead of enumerations when applicable
- Avoid type assertions (as) unless strictly necessary

# React Rules

- Prefer React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Don't use class components
- Use the Context API for shared state when necessary
- Use `useEffect` Responsibly, avoiding unnecessary side effects

# Tailwind CSS Rules

- Use only utility classes
- Don't write custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<section>`)

# File and Folder Organization

- All components should be in the `/components` directory
- All routes/pages should be in the `/app` directory
- Use PascalCase for component files and folders
- Don't mix server and client logic in the same file

# API and Data

- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Fetch data using native `fetch()` or libraries already in the project
- Don't include mock data or sample payloads unless explicitly requested

# Commit Message Rules

- Always prefix commit messages with a conventional commit type: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, style, test.
- Use the format: `<type>: <short description>`
- The type must be one of: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, style, test.
- The scope should be the folder or component affected (optional).
- The description should be written in imperative present tense (e.g., "add new button", not "added" or "adds").
